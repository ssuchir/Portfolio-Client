 ### My Portfolio

This is my first full-stack project. The goal was to build our own API and connect it to a functioning front end. I chose to make an app that allows the user to input and update their current investments in a portfolio. 

 ## Resources
HTML CSS Javascript  JQuery Ajax

 ## Planning
I started this project by first writing user stories that described all of the functionality of the website. Then I created wireframes to picture what I wanted my ideal site to look like. 
After that, I started building the API and tested CRUD actions with curl scripts. This was an important step to make sure everything is connected properly. After the back-end testing, I started to build out the HTML and the main functionalities I wanted from my user stories. I kept the code basic so I could build on it after having the foundation set. At the end I styled my project with a little CSS and bootstrap. 

## Unsolved Problems
I want to make the formating of the actual porfolio to appear in a table that is sorted by date. I want to complete one of the stretch goals of this project which is to connect to a 3rd party API. I found some real-time stock APIs, so if connected, the user would just have to input the stock ticker and the date of purchase. It could then pull the price at purchase and current price, and even provide some useful stock retun calculations.
